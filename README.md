# unit-4-game - $(Crystal.Collector)
*Crystal Collector is a game made using html, css and javascript, more specifically implementing the JQuery language.
The object of the game is to match a randomized value (19-120) that the computer generates and to equal it to the player's score.
The player gets a score simply by clicking on any of the "four" crystal gif images on the webpage.
Each crystal gif contains a randomized value from (1-12) and after each click it is tallied in addition to the player's score.
When a player achieves the equal number to the number generated by the computer, they recieve a point in "wins" and the game restarts with a new randomized number and player's score resets.
If a player's score goes over the value than the number generated, then they recieve a point in the "loss" tallies, the game then resets and another randomized number is created and the player's score resets.
The player has unlimited plays and can play as much as they would like to.
